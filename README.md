## Developers Guide

## Known Issues

Please be aware that not all property-editors will work within Doc Type Grid Editor. The following Umbraco core property-editors are known to have compatibility issues:

* Image Cropper
* Macro Container
* Tags
* Upload

Another known issue is that validation of property-editors within the overlay do not always work. For editors that use client-side (HTML5) validation, this may appear to work, (e.g. text input require attribute is added), but server-side validation does not work.
